{"body":"Number of Players: 2\r\n\r\nGoal: connect opposite sides of the board with a chain of letters.\r\n\r\nEquipment: a deck of cards, 2 pencils, and a copy of the board.\r\n\r\nThe board is included with [the PDF version of the rules][5].\r\n\r\nBlind Hex is a variant of Hex that uses simultaneous movement like that used in \r\nNiebelungenlied. [Hex][1] was designed by Piet Hein in 1942, and independently \r\ndesigned by John Nash in 1947. [Nibelungenlied][2] was designed by Richard \r\nVickery in 2003.\r\n\r\nBlind Hex is [CC-BY-SA][4] Don Kirkby, 2012. Special thanks to playtesters\r\nSheila, Eliza, and Lana.\r\n\r\nSet Up\r\n======\r\n\r\nPlayers choose who will play \"x\" and who will play \"o\". The \"x\" player takes\r\nthe A, 2, 3, 4, 5 of diamonds as her hand, and the \"o\" player takes the \r\nA, 2, 3, 4, 5 of clubs as his hand. The remaining deck is shuffled and the \r\nplayers cut for high card. The losing player must take two cards from her hand\r\nand place them face up on the table, off to the side.  \r\n\r\nPlay\r\n====\r\n\r\nEach turn, each player tries to write his letter in two spaces that will help \r\nhim connect his two sides of the board. The player chooses cards that affect \r\nwhich spaces he can write in.\r\n\r\nStep 1 - Choose Cards\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nPlayers choose two cards each from their hands and both reveal their cards at\r\nthe same time. Aces are treated as the number one.\r\n\r\nStep 2 - Write Letters\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nBased on the chosen cards, the players see where they can write their letters.\r\n\r\nIf both players chose the same two numbers, they write no letters, and the turn\r\nis over.\r\n\r\nIf they choose four different numbers, then each player writes one letter for \r\neach number they chose. Go through the chosen numbers in order, and the player \r\nwho chose each number writes her letter in an empty space with hash marks \r\nmatching that number on at least one side. Some spaces are surrounded by the \r\nsame number on all sides, but most spaces have two different numbers. If there \r\nare no empty spaces with matching hash marks, then the player writes in any \r\nempty space.\r\n\r\nFinally, if the players chose one number in common, then that number is skipped, \r\nand each player writes his letter in two spaces using his other number. For \r\nexample, if Pat chose one and two, and Chris chose two and three, then Pat \r\nwrites in two spaces using the number one, and Chris writes in two spaces using \r\nthe number three.\r\n\r\nStep 3 - Pick Up Cards\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nThe player who has four cards on the table puts them all back in her hand. The\r\nother player should have two cards on the table, and moves them off to the side.\r\n\r\nWinning\r\n=======\r\nThe left and right sides are labelled with x's, and the \"x\" player wins by\r\nwriting the letter \"x\" in an unbroken chain of spaces from the left side to the\r\nright side of the board. The top and bottom are labelled with o's and the \"o\" \r\nplayer wins by writing the letter \"o\" in an unbroken chain of spaces from the \r\ntop to the bottom of the board.\r\n\r\n[1]: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4112/hex\r\n[2]: http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/7555/nibelungenlied\r\n[4]: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\r\n[5]: http://github.com/downloads/donkirkby/blind-hex/blind-hex.pdf","note":"Don't delete this file!
