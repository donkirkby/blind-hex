Blind Hex is a variant of Hex that uses simultaneous movement like that used in 
Niebelungenlied. [Hex][1] was designed by Piet Hein in 1942, and independently 
designed by John Nash in 1947. [Nibelungenlied][2] was designed by Richard 
Vickery in 2003.

Set Up
======

Players choose who will play "x" and who will play "o". The board has the 
numbers from one to five at each end. One set has x's above it, and the other 
has o's. Turn the board so the x's are facing the "x" player and the o's are 
facing the "o" player.

Flip a coin and call it. The loser places two pennies on any two of his numbers. 
The winner places two pennies on any two of her letters.

Play
====

Each turn, each player tries to write his letter in two spaces that will help 
him connect his two sides of the board. The player chooses numbers that affect 
which spaces he can write in.

Step 1 - Choose Numbers
-----------------------

Each player secretly chooses two different numbers between one and five. The 
player with pennies over two numbers cannot choose the covered numbers, but the 
other player can choose any numbers. Both players put their hands behind their 
backs, put out fingers to match their two numbers, and then both players show 
their hands at the same time. Each player then moves their pennies to the new 
numbers. The pennies move between covering numbers and covering letters, so that 
the player who only had three numbers to choose from will have five numbers to 
choose from next turn.

Step 2 - Write Letters
----------------------

Based on the chosen numbers, the players see where they can write their letters.

If both players chose the same two numbers, they write no letters, and the turn 
is over.

If they choose four different numbers, then each player writes one letter for 
each number they chose. Go through the chosen numbers in order, and the player 
who chose each number writes her letter in an empty space with hash marks 
matching that number on at least one side. Some spaces are surrounded by the 
same number on all sides, but most spaces have two different numbers. If there 
are no empty spaces with matching hash marks, then the player writes in any 
empty space.

Finally, if the players chose one number in common, then that number is skipped, 
and each player writes his letter in two spaces using his other number. For 
example, if Pat chose one and two, and Chris chose two and three, then Pat 
writes in two spaces using the number one, and Chris writes in two spaces using 
the number three.

Winning
=======
The "x" player wins by writing the letter "x" in a continuous chain of spaces 
that connect the two sides labelled with x's to each other. The "o" player wins 
by writing the letter "o" in a continuous chain of spaces that connect the two 
sides labelled with o's to each other.
