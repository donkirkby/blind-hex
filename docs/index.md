Blind Hex is a variant of Hex that uses simultaneous movement like that used in
Niebelungenlied. [Hex][1] was designed by Piet Hein in 1942, and independently
designed by John Nash in 1947. [Nibelungenlied][2] was designed by Richard
Vickery in 2003.

Set Up
======

Players choose who will play "x" and who will play "o". The "x" player takes
the A, 2, 3, 4, 5 of diamonds as her hand, and the "o" player takes the
A, 2, 3, 4, 5 of clubs as his hand. The remaining deck is shuffled and the
players cut for high card. The losing player must take two cards from her hand
and place them face up on the table, off to the side.

Play
====

Each turn, each player tries to write his letter in two spaces that will help
him connect his two sides of the board. The player chooses cards that affect
which spaces he can write in.

Step 1 - Choose Cards
---------------------

Players choose two cards each from their hands and both reveal their cards at
the same time. Aces are treated as the number one.

Step 2 - Write Letters
----------------------

Based on the chosen cards, the players see where they can write their letters.

If both players chose the same two numbers, they write no letters, and the turn
is over.

If they choose four different numbers, then each player writes one letter for
each number they chose. Go through the chosen numbers in order, and the player
who chose each number writes her letter in an empty space with hash marks
matching that number on at least one side. Some spaces are surrounded by the
same number on all sides, but most spaces have two different numbers. If there
are no empty spaces with matching hash marks, then the player writes in any
empty space.

Finally, if the players chose one number in common, then that number is skipped,
and each player writes his letter in two spaces using his other number. For
example, if Pat chose one and two, and Chris chose two and three, then Pat
writes in two spaces using the number one, and Chris writes in two spaces using
the number three.

Step 3 - Pick Up Cards
----------------------

The player who has four cards on the table puts them all back in her hand. The
other player should have two cards on the table, and moves them off to the side.

Winning
=======
The left and right sides are labelled with x's, and the "x" player wins by
writing the letter "x" in an unbroken chain of spaces from the left side to the
right side of the board. The top and bottom are labelled with o's and the "o"
player wins by writing the letter "o" in an unbroken chain of spaces from the
top to the bottom of the board.
